# Hi, I'm Alberto 👋

I’m a cybersecurity student pursuing an associate’s degree with a strong interest in hands-on infrastructure, networking, and defensive security. I enjoy building practical systems that solve real problems—especially at the intersection of Linux, networking, and privacy.

## 🔐 Focus Areas

* Network security & DNS-based protections
* Linux system administration (Debian/Kali)
* Self-hosted services on low-power hardware
* VPNs and secure remote access
* Home lab & real-world troubleshooting

---

## 🛠️ Featured Project

### **Pi-hole Network-Wide Ad Blocking (Raspberry Pi Zero W)**

A full end-to-end deployment of Pi-hole as a centralized DNS resolver for a home network.

**What I implemented:**

* Raspberry Pi Zero W running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Legacy)
* Wired Ethernet connectivity for reliability
* Static IP assignment via router DHCP reservation
* Router-level DNS enforcement for network-wide filtering
* Pi-hole configuration and monitoring via web interface
* Secure remote access planned using Tailscale

📁 Repository includes:

* Clear setup documentation
* Networking and DNS architecture explanation
* Troubleshooting notes based on real-world issues

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of DNS, routing, Linux services, and security-focused network design.

## 📚 Learning & Technical Interests

I focus on learning by building and experimenting with real systems and hardware. I’m comfortable moving quickly into unfamiliar tools or technologies, understanding how they work, and integrating them into functional projects.

Current areas of interest include:

* Network security and DNS-based protections
* Linux system administration (Debian, Kali Linux)
* Secure remote access and VPN technologies
* Embedded systems and microcontrollers (ESP32)
* Wireless communication modules and peripheral integration

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Build a strong portfolio of applied cybersecurity projects
* Continue expanding practical knowledge through hands-on experimentation
* Transition into an entry-level cybersecurity or IT security role
